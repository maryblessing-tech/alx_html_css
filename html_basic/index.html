    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Mary-Blessing, and I’m learning web development through the ALX program. This is my first webpage, and I’m excited to explore the world of coding!</p>

    <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
    <p>I started with HTML basics, learning how to structure content properly using tags and elements. Each new concept helps me get one step closer to becoming a front-end developer.</p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>My goal is to design clean, creative, and user-friendly web pages that make people smile when they visit them.</p>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy listening to music and creating art!</p>
